        "The legal sector needs to catch up to the business world because lawyers and law firms have been slower than other use cases to adopt cloud storage in their legal practice. However, since COVID-19 and the rise of online meetings and courtrooms, the legal profession is embracing the cloud faster than before.",
        "Lawyers adopting the cloud as their cloud storage solution still face many challenges in securing and protecting their data against cyberattacks, including ransomware and data breaches.",
        "Law firms also have assumptions about the difficulties they believe switching to cloud storage means. For example, law firms are reluctant to store their files in the cloud because they believe the process is complex, time-consuming, and costly."

        "Since 2020, however, law firms have started to adopt cloud storage faster, despite previous concerns. Lawyers are digitizing their old and recent files and preparing to upload them to the cloud. Law firms favor Internxt due to its clean, easy-to-use interface, affordable and flexible storage plans, and quick upload speeds of large files.",
        "As this use case is related to the field of law, Internxt has additional benefits for law firms utilizing cloud storage. From a legal point of view, companies such as Internxt follow privacy laws from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which governs how companies can use, process, and store personal data.",
        "The GDPR has a global reputation for protecting user data from its many policies that were created to minimize data breaches and other cyberattacks. Not only does this help build trust with its clients by demonstrating a commitment to handling confidential information, but it also helps protect law firms in the case of an attack, as the GDPR implements swift action to minimize the effects of a cyberattack."
