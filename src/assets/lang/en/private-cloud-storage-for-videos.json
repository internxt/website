        "Free cloud storage for video files may work for smaller files, but many free services come with restrictions, and additional features are behind a paywall. It's important to compare pricing and features and determine whether these plans meet your needs.\n\nIf you want cloud storage for large video files, Internxt offers secure cloud storage, VPN, Antivirus, Mail, and Meet in its plans. You can get started for free or from €3 per month for annual or lifetime plans, or store petabytes of videos with Internxt S3 object storage for €7/TB/month.",
        "Secure cloud storage for video files is essential for individual, freelance, or company use, as without it, your content could be at risk. Videos containing sensitive, valuable, or proprietary content require extreme security measures to remain secure and private.\n\nChoose a cloud storage provider that doesn't use AI to scan your content to train its models, and keep your content private by providers that use zero-knowledge encryption to ensure only you can view and access your files.",
        "Storing a library of large video files can quickly use up your cloud storage, leaving you with limited space for new videos or forcing you to delete old files to make room for new projects, which may not be feasible.\n\nChoose a cloud storage provider that allows you to scale your storage based on your needs. When you can easily upgrade your plan, you don't have to worry about migrating all your videos to another service, and you can keep your workflow uninterrupted."
