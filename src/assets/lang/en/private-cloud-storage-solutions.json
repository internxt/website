          "Yes, Internxt is an alternative to Google Drive and other Big Tech companies. These companies encrypt data on servers they own, meaning they can access your account and view your files or give access to your account to the government if requested. ",
          "Unlike these cloud storage platforms, Internxt uses post-quantum and zero-knowledge encryption, so only you can access your files. Your data is encrypted on your device before being uploaded, and no one can view or decrypt it, not even Internxt. This ensures complete privacy, prevents unauthorized access, and protects you from data breaches and surveillance."

Post-quantum encryption focuses on developing algorithms that prevent these computers from decrypting and accessing your data.",
          "This method is ideal for private cloud storage solutions like Internxt because it ensures your data remains secure despite advancing quantum computing technology. "
