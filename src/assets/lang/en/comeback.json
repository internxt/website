        "question": "Can Internxt access my files?",
        "answer": [
          "No. Internxt, along with any other third-party, cannot access your files, photos, or data.",
          "Internxt services feature zero-knowledge encryption, meaning that only you can truly access your private data. Additionally, Internxt's architecture fragments your files before encrypting them, so a server never holds a whole file, just an encrypted shard of it instead, which only you can decrypt."

          "Please note that any remaining time on your current paid subscription will not be refunded or carried over. For instance, if you cancel a one-year plan with four months remaining, you will lose access to those remaining four months.",
          "You can also cancel a paid plan and your Internxt account via settings, which will delete your subscription, account, and all your files."
