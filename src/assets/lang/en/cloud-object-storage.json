        "question": "What is object storage?",
        "answer": [
          "Object storage stores large amounts of data, like photos, videos, and emails, as individual “objects” with unique identifiers.",
          "Unlike traditional file storage, which organizes data in a hierarchical file system, object storage stores data as objects in a flat address space, typically in a distributed storage infrastructure.",
          "As a result, cloud object storage allows for easier scaling, faster access to individual items, and potentially lower costs depending on your storage needs."
        ]

        "question": "What is a S3 protocol?",
        "answer": [
          "The S3 protocol, or Simple Storage Service protocol, is a set of rules and standards that define how data is accessed, stored, and managed within Amazon S3, a popular cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

        "question": "How much object storage do I get?",
        "answer": [
          "With Internxt cloud object storage, you can scale your storage to meet your needs. Our plans charge you monthly for each gigabyte-per-day-used you want to use. You can add or delete storage based on your needs."

        "question": "Can I integrate Internxt object storage with existing applications and services?",
        "answer": [
          "Yes, Internxt object storage is compatible with AWS S3 APIs, allowing seamless integration with a wide range of applications, tools, and services that support the S3 protocol.",
          "S3 object storage allows users to upload, retrieve, and manage objects (files and data) using a simple web interface and APIs. The protocol ensures data integrity, security through access controls, and scalability to accommodate varying storage needs seamlessly across distributed servers."

        "question": "Does Internxt have a minimum monthly storage policy?",
        "answer": [
          "Internxt’s minimum monthly policy for object storage plans is 1TB. If stored objects are deleted before they have been stored with Internxt for 30 days, a time-deleted storage charge will be applied that is equal to the remaining days left on the monthly subscription.",

        "question": "Does Internxt have a monthly storage charge?",
        "answer": [

      {
        "question": "What if I want to store small files? (Less than 4 KB)",
        "answer": [
          "There is a minimum file size charge of 4KB. Storing a 4KB file will incur charges equivalent to a 1TB file. This policy resembles the minimum capacity charge per object policies found in some AWS storage."
        ]
      },
      {
        "question": "What’s the cost of overwriting a file repeatedly without versioning?",
        "answer": [
          "For example, if you upload a file named 'file.pdf' and overwrite it with a new version without changing the file name or using versioning the next day, the original file will transition from active storage to deleted storage.",
          "This incurs charges for one day of active storage and 29 or 89 days of deleted storage, depending on your account's minimum storage retention policy. Additionally, charges will apply for storing the new version of 'file.pdf.'"

          "This policy ensures a minimum charge period for stored data, regardless of how long the objects were actually stored before deletion.",
