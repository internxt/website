          "Object storage stores large amounts of data, like photos, videos, and emails, as individual “objects” with unique identifiers.",
          "Unlike traditional file storage, which organizes data in a hierarchical file system, object storage stores data as objects in a flat address space, typically in a distributed storage infrastructure.",
          "As a result, cloud object storage allows for easier scaling, faster access to individual items, and potentially lower costs depending on your storage needs."

          "S3 object storage allows users to upload, retrieve, and manage objects (files and data) using a simple web interface and APIs. The protocol ensures data integrity, security through access controls, and scalability to accommodate varying storage needs seamlessly across distributed servers."

        "question": "Does Internxt have a minimum monthly storage policy?",
        "answer": [
          "Internxt’s minimum monthly policy for object storage plans is 1TB. If stored objects are deleted before they have been stored with Internxt for 30 days, a time-deleted storage charge will be applied that is equal to the remaining days left on the monthly subscription.",

        "answer": [
          "For example, if you upload a file named 'file.pdf' and overwrite it with a new version without changing the file name or using versioning the next day, the original file will transition from active storage to deleted storage.",
          "This incurs charges for one day of active storage and 29 or 89 days of deleted storage, depending on your account's minimum storage retention policy. Additionally, charges will apply for storing the new version of 'file.pdf.'"
