        "Whereby uses cookies and third‑party tracking technologies for analytics, advertising measurement, and improving services. These include tools from Google Analytics, Amplitude, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn. In doing so, Whereby exposes personal behavior and usage patterns to multiple external companies, creating potential privacy risks and allowing data to be combined or profiled across platforms.",
        "Whereby encrypts audio and video in transit using WebRTC and TLS. Small peer-to-peer meetings use end-to-end encryption (E2EE), so only participants can access the media. In larger meetings, media is decrypted on Whereby’s servers and then re-encrypted for delivery. This means Whereby can access unencrypted streams, so it does not provide true zero-knowledge encryption, which limits privacy.",
        "Whereby is a proprietary platform, meaning its core code is not publicly available or fully open source. Users and developers cannot inspect, modify, or independently verify the internal code that runs the service. This limits transparency and makes it harder for the community to audit security or privacy features compared with open‑source alternatives."
